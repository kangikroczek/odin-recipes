    <h3>How to Cook Asparagus?</h3>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    
    <h4>How to Trim Asparagus</h4>
    <p>The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then use a sharp chef’s knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about cutting at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”</p>
    
    <h4>How to Season Asparagus</h4>
    <p>This asparagus is simply seasoned with fresh garlic, sea salt, and black pepper. Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice also lend tons of flavor. This is a versatile recipe, so feel free to add spices and customize the seasonings to suit your taste.</p>
     
    <h4>How to Cook Asparagus In the Oven</h4>
    <p>Roasting asparagus couldn’t be easier: Toss the asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle it with cheese and seasonings. Arrange the stalks in a single layer in a baking dish, then bake until tender. Sprinkle the roasted asparagus with lemon juice before serving, if you like. </p>

    <h4>How Long to Bake Asparagus</h4>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 425 degrees F, the asparagus should be perfectly roasted after about 12 to 15 minutes. </p>

    <h3>Test Kitchen Tips</h3>
    <p>“This is probably the way I cook asparagus most often,” says culinary producer and test kitchen expert Nicole McLaughlin. “It’s so easy, comes together in one pan, and has so much flavor.” Here are a few of Nicole’s top tips for roasting asparagus perfectly every time: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Though Nicole opts for meatier asparagus stalks for grilling, she prefers thinner stalks for roasting — the skinnier ones tend to crisp up better.</li>
        <li>Choose asparagus that is firm, but has a bit of give. Also, make sure to cut off the woody ends.</li>
        <li>“You don’t want these overlapping or crowding the pan,” Nicole says of the oiled and seasoned asparagus stalks. “Because then they’ll end up steaming and you won’t get all that color.”</li>
    </ul>
